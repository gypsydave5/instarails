Goal
----

Create a pretty-good implementation of Instagram using Ruby on Rails. We'll be
using a PostgreSQL database (for convenience and familiarity's sake), an be
folding in plenty of useful gems along the way.

Technologies Used
-----------------
Ruby...
... on Rails
PostgreSQL

###Gems

- devise
- others to follow

Dependencies
------------

I'm using Ruby 2.1.2. You'll need to have PostgresSQL installed and running on
your system.

Testing
-------

Testing is done with Rspec - just run `rspec` from the root directory to run all
the suites.
